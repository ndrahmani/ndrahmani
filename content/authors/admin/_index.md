I am **Nour-eddine RAHMANI**, a Ph.d student of Mathematics. Currently, my thesis is about Lattice-based cryptography. I am researching under  [ACSA Laboratory](http://lacsa.alghammad.com/) in [Faculty of Science](http://fso.ump.ma/), [Mohammed First University](http://www.ump.ma/). I am interested also in programming, animating mathematics, and some of my hobbies are gaming, anime, manga, and poetry.
